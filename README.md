I used Tenserflow Lite Model Maker library for Image Classificaton Task. The said library uses Transfer Learning which is suitable for our small dataset.

Visit https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/modify/model_maker/image_classification to know more about the scope and limitation of using this library.

If you have an existing flutter project for image classification task you may use the model for testing and evaluation. Please use the quantized model or the "model_fp16.tflite" file.
