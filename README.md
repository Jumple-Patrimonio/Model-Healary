Please visit the tensorflow.ipynb for more information about the training process and model evaluation.

I used Tenserflow Lite Model Maker library for Image Classificaton Task. The said library uses Transfer Learning which is suitable for our small dataset.

Visit https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/modify/model_maker/image_classification to know more about the scope and limitation of using this library.
